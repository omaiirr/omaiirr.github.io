# About

Hi, im omairr, im a relatively new programmer just messing around with stuff and doing it as a hobby.

I first started programming around 2021 when a friend introduced me to programming. My first project was a <span>Java<span> ping pong game, then I created a half working calculator, after that I tried game developing, and I had a lot of fun doing it, I made a small 2d game using the Unity engine. I also tried doing a 3d game with wallruning and other stuff but that didnt go as well, I stopped programming in mid 2022 because my old laptop broke down, now in 2023, I got a new pc and started developing again. I am intrested in <span>Python<span>, <span>C++/C#<span>, <span>JavaScript/TypeScript<span>, and some other languages.
